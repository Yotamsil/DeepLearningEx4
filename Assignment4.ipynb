        "we will need to thoroughly understand the model that we want to build before actually building it. Note that the best and fastest way to complete this assignment is to spend time upfront understanding the architecture. The explanations are quite dense, but it is important to understand the operation of this model. The rationale here is similar in nature to the `seq2seq` RNN model we discussed in class, only we are dealing with unsupervised learning here rather than machine translation. \n",
